# *U-Net for Polyp Segmentation in Colonoscopy Images*  
Medical imaging meets deep learning — this project implements a U-Net-based semantic segmentation model to automatically detect and segment colorectal polyps in colonoscopy images. Accurate segmentation can assist doctors in early diagnosis, treatment planning, and reduce the chances of missed polyps.

## 🤖 Model Architecture
The U-Net architecture consists of:

Encoder: Extracts features using convolution and max-pooling

Decoder: Upsamples features to reconstruct the segmentation mask

Skip Connections: Help retain spatial information from the encoder

## 📌 Future Improvements
-- Add support for real-time video segmentation

-- Integrate with clinical decision systems

-- Try more advanced architectures like U-Net++ or DeepLabV3+

-- Deploy with Streamlit or Flask for live inference

## 👨‍⚕️ Why This Project Matters
Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths worldwide. Early detection of polyps can save lives. This project explores how deep learning can support medical professionals in this crucial task by reducing manual workload and improving accuracy.
